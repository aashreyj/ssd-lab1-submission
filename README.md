<H3 style="text-align: center;"> Lab Activity 1: BASH </H3>

## Assumptions:

- For Q1, I have assumed that the `POST` and `404` status code will be separated by a combination of characters that include alphanumeric characters, numbers and forward slash.

- For Q2, I have assumed that the power level will always be in the last column in the power_levels.txt file.

- For both files, I have assumed that the user has execute permission for the file.

## Executing the file:

`$ /bin/bash 2024202012_q1.sh`  
`$ /bin/bash 2024202012_q2.sh`
